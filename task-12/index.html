                    JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
                    high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
                    typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br><br>

                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript
                    enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
                    websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated
                    JavaScript engine to execute it. <br><br>

                    As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
                    programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
                    regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the
                    language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
                    facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs. <br><br>

                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some
                    servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with
                    frameworks such as Electron and Cordova. <br><br>

                    Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and
                    respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
